Simple CV
=========

A simple easily modifyable LaTeX documenclass to create academic CVs.

To use the class, simply download it and put it somewhere LaTeX can find it.
The `example.tex` file contains an example of how to use the class.

Modifying the layout and formatting should be fairly straightforward.
Just make a copy and follow the comments in the file.
